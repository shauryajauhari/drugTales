<h1>
  Welcome to <i> DRUG TALES </i> !
</h1>

<h2> What? </h2>

<p>
  Drug Tales is an unified interface planned on integrating information from patients, clinicians, and pharmacists
  including pharmaceutical firms; so it has a broad, purported user-base. What we plan on doing is track patients'
  health even after their formal discharge from a hospital/ clinic, or from discussions with a doctor, when either
  has no track of their whereabouts, and possibly establish the prognosis. The doctors would generally suggest a
  prescription and suggest the diseased to undergo a cycle or two. The big question is what after that?

</p>

<h2> Why? </h2>

<p>
  Generally, people from underdeveloped and developing countries wouldn't even have the wisdom, let alone money, to 
  incentivize them visiting the clinician to report their health status, either if they've recovered/ cured or maybe 
  not. Professionals would agree that if you're not doing good even after religiously following <i> what the doctor 
  ordered </i>, you tend to switch doctor, in lieu of going to the one visited erstwhile, and the story ends there. 
  Additionally, the doctor too has no thrust to trace his/ her clients. From the vantage point of ethics too, it is
  a travesty that doctors deny the tenets of medical profession, and the patients are dodging their duties. Following
  these undulations, there is no way to confirm (and build a consensus on) if a medicine is truly effective. These 
  results fuel drug development and push pharmaceutical companies.

</p>

<p>
  This is exactly where <b> DRUGTALES </b> may come in handy. For anyone (patient) connected to Internet, via a modest
  network bandwidth, can report their experiences with doctors, prescriptions, and diagnosis, reporting issues about
  their temporal physiology and side effects (if any) they've experienced. We must not loose sight of the fact that most
  drugs follow commercialization cycle after approval over animal models primary and then a clinical trial, that does
  not necessarily incubate generalization of all documented physiology. This is a compelling notion that corroborates
  the likes of organs-on-chip and biomimetics studies. Even Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI)'s former 
  execute director <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2014.11100">Joe Selby</a> would concur that "listening to 
  patients" is paramount.

<h2> How? </h2>

<p>
  We would like to reciprocate what many intellectuals believe - <i> Data is the new oil </i>. We are looking to harness 
  the potential of the data available on variegated social media platforms, and unravel the feedback loops and comments 
  present in there to understand the trails of a drug administration. This pipeline, as illustrated below, shall work in 
  tandem (in the background) to fetch the contemporary conversations on the medicines, and amalgamate the information to
  the <b> DrugTales </b> platform, thus ameliorating its dexterity.

  We came across a relevant publication in this category- <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS.2016.7440000"> PeopleSave</a>. 
  The paper “PeopleSave: Recommending effective drugs through web crowdsourcing” introduces a system that leverages patient reviews from
  the internet to recommend effective drugs. By collecting and filtering reviews from various online sources, PeopleSave ensures the 
  reliability of the information and analyzes it contextually to understand patient-reported outcomes. The system’s architecture includes
  modules for data collection, filtering, contextual analysis, and recommendation generation, using advanced algorithms to process natural
  language. The evaluation shows that PeopleSave’s recommendations align well with actual patient outcomes, demonstrating the potential 
  of web crowdsourcing in enhancing drug recommendation accuracy and relevance. The study highlights the benefits and challenges of this
  approach, suggesting future improvements for more patient-centered healthcare.

<p>
  We want to carry forward the baton by not just crowdsourcing the feedbacks on drugs, which not only do we attempt to enhance further, 
  albeit also superlay the dedicated and upfront feedbacks from the DrugTales interface.
