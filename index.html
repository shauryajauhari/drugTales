<h1>
  Welcome to <i> DRUG TALES </i> !
</h1>

<h2> What? </h2>

<p>
  Drug Tales is an unified interface planned on integrating information from patients, clinicians, and pharmacists
  including pharmaceutical firms; so it has a broad, purported user-base. What we plan on doing is track patients'
  health even after their formal discharge from a hospital/ clinic, or from discussions with a doctor, when either
  has no track of their whereabouts, and possibly establish the prognosis. The doctors would generally suggest a
  prescription and suggest the diseased to undergo a cycle or two. The big question is what after that?

</p>

<h2> Why? </h2>

<p>
  Generally, people from underdeveloped and developing countries wouldn't even have the wisdom, let alone money, to 
  incentivize them visiting the clinician to report their health status, either if they've recovered/ cured or maybe 
  not. Professionals would agree that if you're not doing good even after religiously following <i> what the doctor 
  ordered </i>, you tend to switch doctor, in lieu of going to the one visited erstwhile, and the story ends there. 
  Additionally, the doctor too has no thrust to trace his/ her clients. From the vantage point of ethics too, it is
  a travesty that doctors deny the tenets of medical profession, and the patients are dodging their duties. Following
  these undulations, there is no way to confirm (and build a consensus on) if a medicine is truly effective. These 
  results fuel drug development and push pharmaceutical companies.

</p>

<p>
  This is exactly where <b> DRUGTALES </b> may come in handy. For anyone (patient) connected to Internet, via a modest
  network bandwidth, can report their experiences with doctors, prescriptions, and diagnosis, reporting issues about
  their temporal physiology and side effects (if any) they've experienced. We must not loose sight of the fact that most
  drugs follow commercialization cycle after approval over animal models primary and then a clinical trial, that does
  not necessarily incubate generalization of all documented physiology. This is a compelling notion that corroborates
  the likes of organs-on-chip and biomimetics studies.
